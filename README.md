# My Personal Collection of Helm Charts
[![](https://github.com/kilip/helm-charts/workflows/Release%20Charts/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kilip/helm-charts/actions)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add kilip https://charts.itstoni.com/
```

You can then run `helm search repo kilip` to see the charts.
